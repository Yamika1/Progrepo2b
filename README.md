The database design includes a sidebar to access the entities included in my MVC app such as the lecturer section and lecturer view claim section, contractor section, admin section which is broken down into the academic manager and the programme coordinator sections. The app displays an image on the home page too when the app is run and the background colour is medium purple when one of the pages are loaded. The system aims to be easy to use and straightforward helping users handle contracts, and claims, by storing them and letting them be reviewed once they are added to the system. The reason I mainly chose MVC was because it provides a clearer structure and is easy to maintain.
